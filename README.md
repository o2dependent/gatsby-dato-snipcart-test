# SnipCart, Gatsby, DatoCMS. Oh my!

SnipCart is a great tool for implementing into a Gatsby site. Not only is it easy to set up for developers, but it makes it easy for clients to update content. Using an interface like DatoCMS makes the creation of products quick and easy.

This is a simple theme set up throught the Gatsby starter template. The SnipCart version is not updated to V3 in this version as I am currently hosting a V3 site for a client. If you are interested in checking out the V3 send me a message!
